# Lexical-Analyzer
This is a c++ Compiler Construction project which can generate tokens for your code. You can simply add the program code in program text file and it can generate tokens in output text file. 

# Limitations:
It only runs for a specific code input as this lexical analyser was designed to create a new programming language and generating tokens for the same.
